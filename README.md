# PICU_project
Cambridge MPhil in Computational Biology: Thesis project analysing PICU data from GOSH Digital Research Environment. All of the code used for the thesis will be here (and some other random files). It does not contain any patient data but contains all of my scripts and other relevant files, along with my figures.

## Scripts
This folder contains all of the processing pipeline in Processing, of the model tuning files in Tuning_files, all of the final network testing files in Final_test, other models including XGBoost and Logistic regressions in Other_models, and files for plotting in Plotting. It also contains some other random files in Random_scripts. The processing pipeline involves running the PICU_wrangling.py file, followed by the Param_correction.R file, followed by the Pandas_to_np.py file.

## Figs
This contains all of the figures I have made so far. The relevant figures for the project are in figs/PICU and are reasonably self explanatory

## Models
All of the model structures, saved models and best results from the hyperparameter tuning are here

## Files
Contains all of the final model results alongside means and SDs generated by the rriskDistributions package in the calculate mean file.

## Mimic practice data and other practice data (not relevant synthetic data however)
This is contained in the mimic datasets folder and practice data folder
