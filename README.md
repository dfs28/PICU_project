# PICU_project
Cambridge MPhil in Computational Biology: Thesis project analysing PICU data from GOSH Digital Research Environment. All of the code used for the thesis will be here (and some other random files). It does not contain any patient data but contains all of my scripts and other relevant files, along with my figures.

## Scripts
This folder contains some practice files including the mimic wrangling file and some other practice scripts.
It also contains the PICU wrangling file, which includes all of the feature engineering. It is currently a bit of a mess but I plan to clean it up.
It also contains a file named autoencoder which is the current progress on making a neural network using keras. I probably won't however be using an autoencoder.

## Figs
This contains all of the figures I have made so far - it's a bit of a mess.

## Files
Contains some relevant files including means and SDs generated by the rriskDistributions package in the calculate mean file.

## Mimic practice data
This is contained in the mimic practice data file.
